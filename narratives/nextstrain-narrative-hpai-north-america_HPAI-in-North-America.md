# [Introduction to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5n1/ha?animate=1996-03-10,2023-10-11,1,1,30000&d=map&p=full) 

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has disseminated globally since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in Guangdong China in 1996, resulting in outbreaks primarily throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa.

*Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has disseminated globally since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in Guangdong China in 1996, resulting in outbreaks primarily throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa.* 

Late 2021, HPAI H5Nx belonging to clade 2.3.4.4.b was introduced into North America and has rapidly spread throughout the continent. 

Using phylogenetics, we can infer the introductions of this virus into the US, identify patterns of spread between species and regions, and identify mutations that have arisen during this outbreak.

### Origins
Phylogenetic reconstruction allows us to infer the introductions into North America that seeded this outbreak. 

Looking at the global dynamics of H5Nx since 2021, we can see that the major introduction responsible for the majority of infections (the main branch) came from Europe. 

There were additionally multiple separate introductions from Asia during this time, however these have not seemed to have contributed to onward transmission within North America. 

This global phylogenetic reconstruction also shows that introduction into North America has led to further spread of HPAI to new regions during this outbreak, including South America (orange) and most recently, Antarctica (dark blue).

### Onward spread
Zooming in to just North America, we can further analyze transmission dynamics and the factors contributing to the spread within the continent. 

Coloring by migratory flyway, we can see that the main branch originating from Europe was introduced to the Atlantic flyway, whereas the smaller branch introduced from Asia entered via the Pacific flyway. Viruses largely cluster within flyways with some transmission between flyways. 

# [What is unique about this outbreak?](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=Domestic_Status&d=tree,map&p=grid&r=division)

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part I

This outbreak has resulted in high rates of infection in non-canonical wild bird species, as well as non-human mammal infections. 

Here, when we look at sequences as coming from wild or domestic (birds), mammals, or backyard birds, we see a high involvement of wild birds, as well infections of non-human mammals throughout North America. 

Backyard birds are designated as smaller-scale non-commercial domestic poultry (primarily chickens, yellow). Backyard birds infections are represented throughout the phylogeny which suggests their potential role as an intermediary facilitating infection beween wild and domestic birds.

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part II

The typical main drivers in HPAI outbreaks and spread are anseriformes (chickens) and galliformes (ducks and geese). If we analyze the types of birds affected in this outbreak at a higher resolution, we see that while these are still the predominant drivers of this outbreak, there are substantial numbers of infections in other avian orders including many raptors (eagles, vultures, owls, and hawks) and many passerines (primarily corvids). 

These infections have implications for conservation, as well as novel transmission dynamics with HPAI reaching new ecological niches and species interactions.

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 2. Mammal infections 

In addition to non-canonical wild bird infections, this outbreak has also resulted in high incidences of mammal infections. These mammal infections have occured throughout North America, and primarily are affecting marine mammals (in the US, seals) and small carnivores (foxes, skunks, etc.).

A snapshot of the novel diversity of species involved in this outbreak is exemplified in this branch of infections in New England summer 2022.


At the top of this branch, we see identical sequences collected from gulls, terns, geese, harbor seals, a grey seal, and peregrine falcons in Maine and Massachussetts. This exemplifies the high level of species interaction annd diversity involved, and thus the significant challenge of controlling this outbreak.

Using Nextstrain filtering functionalities, we can also assess the prevalence of mutations of interest. 

### Mammalian adaptations, part I:

Given the high incidences of mammalian infections during this outbreak, the presence of mammalian host adaptations arising is a significant concern. 

One such mutation is PB2 E267K, which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in teh same position, PB2 E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also present in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.

### Mammalian adaptations, part II:

*One such mutation is PB2 E267K which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in the same position, E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also found at lower rates in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.* 

By filtering the tree and map to just these sequences containing the PB2 267K mutation, we can contextualize them in space and time. Here, we see the PB2 mutation is present throughout the phylogeny and in samples from 10 states and one Canadian province, indiciating that this mutation has arisen independently multiple times during this outbreak.
