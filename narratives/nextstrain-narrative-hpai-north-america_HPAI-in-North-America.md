abstract: "In December of 2021, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) of the H5 subtype were detected in wild and domestic birds in Newfoundland, Canada. Since then, H5Nx has spread throughout the Americas, impacting wildlife, agricultural animals, and human health. Viral genomes contain molecular records of viral transmission histories that can be used to reconstruct how viruses move across time, space, and host groups. In this report, we present an overview of the HPAI H5Nx outbreak that began in 2021 in North America, and how it has evolved over time. This work highlights the utility of phylogenetics for interrogating outbreak dynamics, and is built on the incredible surveillance and outbreak response activities by scientists at the USDA."

# [Introduction to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5n1/ha?animate=1996-03-10,2023-10-11,1,1,30000&d=map&p=full) 

### Emergence and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza

Influenza A viruses naturally circulate in wild, aquatic birds. Influenza viruses are divided into subtypes determined by the combination of their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA, or H), of which there are 16 subtypes, and neuraminidase (NA, or N), of which there are 9. While H5N1 is the predominant subtype of the current highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak, these viruses frequently reassort to generate other HA/NA combinations. Reassortment occurs when distinct viruses co-infect the same cell, and shuffle their genomes to generate new subtypes. Because of the propensity of currently circulating H5 viruses to acquire new NA subtypes via reassortment, they are collectively referred to as "H5Nx" viruses. Viruses are further classified into [clades](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5nx/ha?c=gisaid_clade), which are determined based on HA gene sequence similarity. Viruses in the present outbreak belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. 

Avian influenza viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity, and are designated as high-path (HP) or low-path (LP) based on their ability to cause disease in domestic chickens. Genetically, this pathogenic outcome is primarily determined by the absence (in LP) or presence (in HP) of a polybasic HA cleavage site. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses were first discovered during outbreaks in Asia in 1996, and have since disseminated globally by a combination of wild bird migration and poultry trade, causing outbreaks in humans and domestic birds in Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is currently thought that transmission in poultry establishes endemic lineages that disseminate regionally, while wild birds can periodically spread these viruses across vast geographic distances. A notable example of this occurred when migrating, [wild birds carried HPAI into North America in 2015](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf8852), sparking an H5N8 outbreak that resulted in widespread impacts on US agriculture. However, this outbreak was successfully extinguished following extensive culling of domestic birds.

### The outbreak in 2021

In 2021, an H5Nx outbreak began in the Americas that has been unusual in several key ways: 1. despite extensive culling in agricultural birds, detections are [still occurring]((https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai)); 2. the outbreak has spread geographically to much higher degree than past outbreaks; 3. there have been an unusally high number of infections in wild mammals, including seals, sea lions, and foxes. Understanding how these viruses were introduced and transmitted throughout the Americas is critical for designing effective public health interventions and risk assessments. In this narrative, we will explore the ways in which we can use viral sequence data to reconstruct the outbreak and identify potential future avenues for investigation and public health intervention. 

# [Where do these data come from?](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/global-2021-present/ha?d=tree&p=full)

The USDA has been leading outbreak investigation in the United States, and compiles case counts for every test positive case of HPAI in domestic and wild animals. These infections are confirmed via PCR testing of animals as part of ongoing surveillance and when infections are suspected. As part of this surveillance and testing program, USDA scientists generate whole genome sequence data and upload these data to public databases like GISAID and Genbank. We are extremely grateful to the USDA for their fantastic outbreak response and timely data sharing. Other scientists across the Americas have also contributed sequence data to public repositories, and this narrative is built off of this global network of data sharing.

### Origins

Phylogenetic reconstruction allows us to infer the introductions into North America that seeded this outbreak. 

Looking at the global dynamics of H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b since 2021, we can see that the major introduction responsible for the majority of infections (the main red branch) came from Europe. 

There were additionally multiple separate introductions from Asia during this time, however these have seemingly not contributed to onward transmission within North America. 

This global phylogenetic reconstruction also shows that introduction into North America has led to further spread and introduction of HPAI to new regions during this outbreak, including South America (orange) and most recently, Antarctica (dark blue).

Since this introduction in late 2021 into North America, HPAI H5Nx viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4.b have rapidly spread rapidly throughout the continent. 

Using phylogenetics, we can further identify patterns of spread between species and regions, and identify mutations that have arisen during this outbreak.

### Onward spread
One reason we have seen such rapid spread throughout the continent is likely due to the virus spreading with the movement of wild birds. 

Coloring by migratory flyway, we can see that the main branch originating from Europe was introduced to the Atlantic flyway, whereas the smaller branch introduced from Asia entered via the Pacific flyway. Viruses largely cluster within flyways with some transmission between flyways.

# [What is unique about this outbreak?](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=Domestic_Status&d=tree,map&p=grid&r=division)

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part I

This outbreak has resulted in high rates of infection in non-canonical wild bird species, as well as non-human mammal infections. 

Here, when we look at sequences as coming from wild or domestic (birds), mammals, or backyard birds, we see a high involvement of wild birds, as well infections of non-human mammals throughout North America. 

Backyard birds are designated as smaller-scale non-commercial domestic poultry (primarily chickens, yellow). Backyard bird infections are represented throughout the phylogeny which suggests their potential role as an intermediary facilitating infection beween wild and domestic birds *(Click on the dropdown arrow to open the 'Domestic Status' legend, and hover over the key for Backyard Birds to see more clearly)*.

*An important caveat to this analysis is sampling biases and limitations. Information on backyard bird status is only available from the initial outbreak period in spring 2022, therefore their role in ongoing transmission and maintenance is presently unknown. Additionally, wildbirds are undersampled and difficult to sample, making this outbreak especially difficult to understand and analyze entirely.*

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part II

The typical main species involved in HPAI outbreaks and spread are anseriformes (chickens) and galliformes (ducks and geese). When we analyze the types of birds affected in this outbreak at a higher resolution, we see that anseriformes and galliformes are still the predominant drivers of this outbreak. However, there are also substantial numbers of infections in other avian orders including many raptors (eagles, vultures, owls, and hawks) and many passerines (primarily corvids). 

These infections have implications for conservation, as well as novel transmission dynamics with HPAI reaching new ecological niches and species interactions.

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 2. Mammal infections 

In addition to non-canonical wild bird infections, this outbreak has also resulted in high incidences of mammal infections. The position of these samples at tips throughout the tree indicate multiple independent introductions into mammals with no onward spread from these mammal infections. 

*(Scroll down on the right hand panel to see the map view below the tree).* 
These mammal infections have occured throughout North America, and primarily are affecting marine mammals (in the US, seals) and small carnivores (foxes, skunks, etc.). The primarily northern distribution of mammalian infections is due to red foxes being the most commonly infected mammal sampled in this outbreak.

A snapshot of the novel diversity of species involved in this outbreak is exemplified in this branch of infections in New England summer 2022.


At the top of this branch, we see identical sequences collected from gulls, terns, geese, harbor seals, a grey seal, and peregrine falcons in Maine and Massachussetts. This highlights the high level of species interaction and diversity involved, and thus the significant challenge of controlling this outbreak.

Using Nextstrain filtering functionalities, we can also assess the prevalence of mutations of interest. 

### Mammalian adaptations, part I:

Given the high incidences of mammalian infections during this outbreak, the presence of mammalian host adaptations arising is a significant concern. 

One such mutation is PB2 E267K, which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in the same position, PB2 E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also present in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.

### Mammalian adaptations, part II:

*One such mutation is PB2 E267K which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in the same position, E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also found at lower rates in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.* 

By filtering the tree and map to just these sequences containing the PB2 267K mutation, we can contextualize them in space and time. Here, we see the PB2 mutation is present throughout the phylogeny and in samples from 10 states and one Canadian province, indiciating that this mutation has arisen independently multiple times during this outbreak. 

# [Conclusions](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=geo_region_na&d=tree&gmin=4&p=full&r=division)

### Take home messages:

The current outbreak of the HPAI in North America has been unprecedented in scope and scale, with devestating consequences for both agriculture and wild animals, especially due to subsequent spread to South America and Antarctica. High levels of wild avian and mammalian diversity involved have rendered previous control measures- such as domestic poultry culling- insufficient.

#### Future outlook:

It is uncertain how this outbreak will progress and what the future holds of HPAI in North America. If it follows a similar trajectory to Europe, we could see endemicity of HPAI with seasonal outbreaks. It remains to be seen how this could impact ecology and agriculture.

Given this uncertainty- and complicated ecology of this outbreak- we need continued and increased surveillance in wild birds to understand both the current dynamics and better predict and curtail future outbreaks and spread.
