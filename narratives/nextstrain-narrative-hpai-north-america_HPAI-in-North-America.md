# [Introduction to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5n1/ha?animate=1996-03-10,2023-10-11,1,1,30000&d=map&p=full) 

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has disseminated globally since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in Guangdong China in 1996, resulting in outbreaks primarily throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has disseminated globally since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in Guangdong China in 1996, resulting in outbreaks primarily throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. 

Late 2021, HPAI H5Nx belonging to clade 2.3.4.4.b was introduced into North America and has rapidly spread throughout the continent. 

Using phylogenetics, we can infer the introductions of this virus into the US, identify patterns of spread between species and regions, and identify mutations that have arisen during this outbreak.

### Origins
Phylogenetic reconstruction allows us to infer the introductions into North America that seeded this outbreak. Looking at the global dynamics of H5Nx since 2021, we can see that the major introduction responsible for the majority of infections (the main branch) came from Europe. There were additionally multiple separate introductions from Asia during this time, however these have not seemed to have contributed to onward transmission within North America. Global phylogenetic reconstruction also shows how introduction into North America has led to further spread of HPAI to new regions, including South America (orange) and most recently, Antarctica (dark blue.

### Onward spread
Focusing on just North America, we can further analyze transmission dynamics and the factors contributing to the spread within the continent. Coloring by migratory flyway, we can see that the main branch originating from Europe was introduced to the Atlantic flyway, whereas the smaller branch introduced from Asia entered via the Pacific flyway. Viruses largely cluster within flyways with some transmission between flyways. 

# [What is unique about this outbreak?](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=Domestic_Status&p=grid&r=division)

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. the role of wild birds

The involvement and infection of non-canonical wild bird species and a high rate of non-human mammal infections. In this Nextstrain view, the tree is colored by host type. Here we see a high involvement of wild birds, as well infections of non-human mammals throughout North America. Backyard birds are designated as smaller-scale non-commercial domestic poultry (primarily chickens). Backyard birds infections are represented throughout the phylogeny which supports their potential role as an intermediary facilitating infection beween wild and domestic birds.

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. the role of wild birds

This outbreak has seen unprecedented involvement and infection of non-canonical wild bird species and a high rate of non-human mammal infections. The typical main players in HPAI outbreaks and spread are anseriformes (chickens) and galliformes (ducks and geese). If we analyze the types of birds affected in this outbreak at a higher resolution, we see that while these are still the predominant drivers of this outbreak, there is a large proportion of other avian orders including many raptors (eagles, vultures, owls, and hawks) and many passerines (primarily corvids).

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 2. high incidences of mammal infections 

In addition to non-canonical bird infections, this outbreak has also resulted in high incidences of mammal infections. These mammal infections have occured throughout North America, and primarily are affecting marine mammals (in the US, seals) and small carnivores (foxes, skunks, etc.)

Overall, we can see a huge diversity of species involved in this outbreak, as exemplified through the numerous avian orders shown here.

Using Nextstrain filtering functionalities, we can also assess the prevalence of mutations of interest. 

### Mammalian adaptations:

Given the high incidences of mammalian infections during this outbreak, the presence of mammalian host adaptations arising is a significant concern. One such mutation is PB2 E267K, which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in teh same position, PB2 E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also present in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.

PB2 E267K is also found at lower rates in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection. 

This view filters for samples containing the PB2 267K mutation, colored by domestic status (Wild Bird, Domestic Bird, Backyard Bird, or Nonhuman Mammal). The muatation is present throughout the phylogeny and in samples from 10 states and one Canadian province, indiciating that this mutation has arisen independently multiple times during this outbreak.
