# [Introduction to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza](https://nextstrain.org/flu/avian/h5n1/ha?animate=1996-03-10,2023-10-11,1,1,30000&d=map&p=full) 

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has disseminated globally since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in Guangdong China in 1996, resulting in outbreaks primarily throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. 

Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes determined by the combination of their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (H), for which there are 16, and neuraminidase (N), for which there are 9 which infect birds. Each combination of H and N is a different subtype. H5N1 is the predominant subtype of the current HPAI outbreak, however some other N subtypes are inolved as well, thus we primarily refer to the viruses in this outbreak as "H5Nx". Viruses are further classified into clades, which is a determined based on HA gene sequence similarity. Viruses in the present outbreak belong to clade 2.3.4.4b.

Avian influenza viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity, which is designated as high-path (HP) or low-path (LP) due to their ability to cause disease in domestic chickens. This pathogenic outcome is primarily determined by the absence (LP) or presence (HP) of a polybasic HA cleavage site. Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir host for avian influenza.

### Origins
Phylogenetic reconstruction allows us to infer the introductions into North America that seeded this outbreak. 

Looking at the global dynamics of H5Nx since 2021, we can see that the major introduction responsible for the majority of infections (the main branch) came from Europe. 

There were additionally multiple separate introductions from Asia during this time, however these have not seemed to have contributed to onward transmission within North America. 

This global phylogenetic reconstruction also shows that introduction into North America has led to further spread of HPAI to new regions during this outbreak, including South America (orange) and most recently, Antarctica (dark blue).

Since this introduction in late 2021 into North America, HPAI H5Nx belonging to clade 2.3.4.4.b w has rapidly spread rapidly throughout the continent. 

Using phylogenetics, we can further identify patterns of spread between species and regions, and identify mutations that have arisen during this outbreak.

### Since 2022 in the United States, HPAI H5Nx has been detected in:

* 200 mammals in 19 species and 26 states.
* Over 8,500 wild birds in 50 states.
* Over 1,000 commercial and backyard poultry flocks (over 77 million birds in 47 states).
* One human in April 2022 in the US.

### Onward spread
One reason we have seen such rapid spread throughout the continent is likely facilitated through the movement of wild birds. 

Coloring by migratory flyway, we can see that the main branch originating from Europe was introduced to the Atlantic flyway, whereas the smaller branch introduced from Asia entered via the Pacific flyway. Viruses largely cluster within flyways with some transmission between flyways.

# [What is unique about this outbreak?](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=Domestic_Status&d=tree,map&p=grid&r=division)

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part I

This outbreak has resulted in high rates of infection in non-canonical wild bird species, as well as non-human mammal infections. 

Here, when we look at sequences as coming from wild or domestic (birds), mammals, or backyard birds, we see a high involvement of wild birds, as well infections of non-human mammals throughout North America. 

Backyard birds are designated as smaller-scale non-commercial domestic poultry (primarily chickens, yellow). Backyard birds infections are represented throughout the phylogeny which suggests their potential role as an intermediary facilitating infection beween wild and domestic birds.

*An important caveat to this analysis is sampling biases and limitations. Information on backyard bird status is only available from the initial outbreak period in spring 2022, therefore their role in ongoing transmission and maintenance is presently unknown. Additionally, wildbirds are undersampled and difficult to sample, making this outbreak especially difficult to understand and analyze appropriately.*

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 1. The role of wild birds, part II

The typical main drivers in HPAI outbreaks and spread are anseriformes (chickens) and galliformes (ducks and geese). If we analyze the types of birds affected in this outbreak at a higher resolution, we see that while these are still the predominant drivers of this outbreak, there are substantial numbers of infections in other avian orders including many raptors (eagles, vultures, owls, and hawks) and many passerines (primarily corvids). 

These infections have implications for conservation, as well as novel transmission dynamics with HPAI reaching new ecological niches and species interactions.

There are several unique attributes to this outbreak that have not been recognized in prior outbreaks.

### 2. Mammal infections 

In addition to non-canonical wild bird infections, this outbreak has also resulted in high incidences of mammal infections. These mammal infections have occured throughout North America, and primarily are affecting marine mammals (in the US, seals) and small carnivores (foxes, skunks, etc.). The primarily northern distribution of mammalian infections is due to red foxes being the most commonly infected mammal sampled in this outbreak.

A snapshot of the novel diversity of species involved in this outbreak is exemplified in this branch of infections in New England summer 2022.


At the top of this branch, we see identical sequences collected from gulls, terns, geese, harbor seals, a grey seal, and peregrine falcons in Maine and Massachussetts. This exemplifies the high level of species interaction annd diversity involved, and thus the significant challenge of controlling this outbreak.

# [Viral evolution](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/pb2?branches=hide&c=gt-PB2_627&d=tree&gmax=2283&gmin=4&l=scatter&p=full&r=division&scatterX=Domestic_Status&scatterY=gt)

Using Nextstrain filtering functionalities, we can also assess the prevalence of mutations of interest. 

### Mammalian adaptations, part I:

Given the high incidences of mammalian infections during this outbreak, the presence of mammalian host adaptations arising is a significant concern. 

One such mutation is PB2 E267K, which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in teh same position, PB2 E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also present in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.

*One such mutation is PB2 E267K which is associated with mammalian host adaption. PB2 E267K- as well as a different amino acid substitution in the same position, E627V- are present in 14% of nonhuman mammal infections. PB2 E267K is also found at lower rates in wild birds, domestic birds, and a single sampled backyard bird infection.* 

By filtering the tree and map to just these sequences containing the PB2 267K mutation, we can contextualize them in space and time. Here, we see the PB2 mutation is present throughout the phylogeny and in samples from 10 states and one Canadian province, indiciating that this mutation has arisen independently multiple times during this outbreak. 

# [Conclusions](https://nextstrain.org/groups/moncla-lab/h5nx/north-america/ha?c=geo_region_na&d=tree&gmin=4&p=full&r=division)

### Take home messages:

The current outbreak of the HPAI in North America has been unprecedented in scope and scale, with detrimental consequences due to subsequent spread to South America and Antarctica. High levels of species or avian and mammalian diversity involved have rendered previous control measures- such as domestic poultry culling- insufficient

#### Future outlook:

It is uncertain how this outbreak will progress and what the future holds of HPAI in North America. If it follows a similar trajectory to Europe, we could see endemicity of HPAI with seasonal outbreaks. It remains to be seen how this could impact ecology and agriculture.

Given this uncertainty- and complicated ecology of this outbreak- we need continued and increased surveillance in wild birds to understand both the current dynamics and better predict and curtail future outbreaks and spread.
